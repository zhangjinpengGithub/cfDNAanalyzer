### Supported features
### 1.  Genome-wide features:
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1  <ins>C</ins>opy <ins>N</ins>umber <ins>A</ins>lterations (CNA) ([<ins>Adalsteinsson *et al, Nat. Commun.*, 2017</ins>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00965-y))<br>
* Copy number alterations comprise deletions or amplifications of a particular region of the genome, with a size as low as a few kilobases up to entire chromosomes. 
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2  <ins>E</ins>nd <ins>M</ins>otif frequency and diversity (EM) ([<ins>Lee *et al, PNAS*, 2018</ins>](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1815031116) ; [<ins>Jiang *et al, Cancer Discov.*, 2020</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0622))
* End motifs are the terminal n-nucleotide sequence (4-mer end motif in this toolkit) at each 5′ fragment end of cfDNA molecules. End motif frequency refers to the frequency of all 256 4-mer end motifs.<br>
* End motif diversity is the normalized Shannon entropy of the categorical distribution of all possible 4-mer end-motifs of all cfDNA fragments.

* Fragmentation profile describes fragmentation patterns of cfDNA across the genome, which is the fraction of short cfDNA fragments (100–150 bp) to long cfDNA fragments (151–220 bp) for each 5Mb window across the genome.

### 2.  Region-specific features: 
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1  <ins>N</ins>ucleosome <ins>O</ins>ccupancy and <ins>F</ins>uzziness (NOF) ([<ins>Li *et al, Genome Med.*, 2024</ins>](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01280-6))
* Nucleosome occupancy reflects the frequency with which nucleosomes occupy a given genomic region in a cell population. Nucleosome occupancy for a specific region is calculated as the average occupancy values of all based in this region.<br>
* Nucleosome fuzziness is defined as the deviation of nucleosome positions within a region in a cell population and could reflect cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level. Nucleosome fuzziness for a specific region is calculated as the average fuzziness of all the nucleosomes whose center is located within the region.<br>
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <ins>N</ins>ucleosome <ins>P</ins>rofile (NP) ([<ins>Doebley *et al, Nat. Commun.*, 2022</ins>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35076-w))
* Nucleosome profile is a composite coverage profile computed as the mean of the GC-corrected cfDNA fragment midpoint coverage across a set of sites (Binding sites sets of 377 transcription factors as the dafalut). For each set of sites, three features are identified from the composite coverage profile:
   * (1) The average coverage value from ± 30 bp of the central site of each set (central coverage).
   * (2) The average coverage value from ± 1000 bp of the central site of each set (mean coverage).
   * (3) The overall nucleosome peak amplitude is calculated by using a Fast Fourier Transform on the window ± 960 bp from the site and taking the amplitude of the 10th frequency term (amplitude).
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3  <ins>W</ins>indowed <ins>P</ins>rotection <ins>S</ins>core (WPS) ([<ins>Snyder *et al, Cell*, 2016</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.050))
* Windowed protection score is the number of DNA fragments completely spanning a window centered at a given genomic coordinate minus the number of fragments with an endpoint within that same window. WPS can be calculated using long fragments (120–180 bp; 120 bp window) or short fragments (35–80 bp; 16 bp window). The WPS for a specific region is defined as the average WPS of all bases in this region. High WPS values indicate increased protection of DNA from digestion while low values indicate that DNA is unprotected.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4  <ins>O</ins>rientation-aware <ins>C</ins>fDNA <ins>F</ins>ragmentation (OCF) ([<ins>Sun *et al, Genome Res.*, 2019</ins>](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/3/418.long))

### 3.  TSS-based features: 
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 <ins>P</ins>romoter <ins>F</ins>ragmentation <ins>E</ins>ntropy (PFE) ([<ins>Esfahani *et al, Nat. Biotechnol.*, 2022</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01222-4))<br>
* Promoter fragmentation entropy quantifies the diversity of cfDNA fragment lengths around the TSSs of genes. It is calculated by a modified Shannon index for lengths of cfDNA fragment where both ends fell within ±1 kb of the TSS. Then this cfDNA entropy measure is adjusted using a Dirichlet-multinomial model for normalization. Finally, we Z-score this entropy value for genes in every sample.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 <ins>TSS</ins> <ins>C</ins>overage (TSSC) ([<ins>Ulz *et al, Nat. Genet.*, 2016</ins>](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3648))
* TSS coverage refers to the cfDNA sequencing read coverage in the regions surrounding TSSs.

### Supported feature processing methods and machine learning models

### 1. Feature processing 

#### 1.1 Missing data removal
* In this step, columns containing missing values are removed to ensure the data is ready for downstream analysis.

#### 1.2 Data standardization

* This process transforms the data using one of the following data standardization/normalization method, which is important for many machine-learning techniques. 

| Methods | Alias | Brief Introduction |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Z-Score | *Zscore* | Z-Score scales the features to mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. |

| Robust Scaling | *RS* | Robust Scaling standardizes data by subtracting the median and dividing by the interquartile range (IQR), making it resistant to outliers. |
| Quantile Transformation | *QT* | Quantile Transformation non-linearly maps data to a target distribution (e.g., Gaussian or uniform) using quantiles, making the transformed data robust to outliers and strictly follow the desired distribution. |

### 2. Feature selection

Feature selection is an important step in machine leanring. It involves removing irrelevant or redundant features based on importance rankings, which can help reduce model complexity and enhance the model's ability to make accurate predictions. Here we provide **four methods (filter, embedded, wrapper, and hybrid methods)** for feature selection ( [<ins>Pudjihartono *et al, Front. Bioinform.*, 2022</ins>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9580915/)), as follows:

#### 2.1 Filter methods

Filter methods apply statistical tests to assess and rank features for their relevance to the target variable, independent of the classification algorithm. These methods can be executed by computing the correlation between features and the target variable, subsequently eliminating features with low scores.

| Methods | Alias | Brief Introduction | Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:                                                   |
| Information Gain | *IG* | Information Gain measures the reduction in uncertainty of the target variable when a specific feature is known. Higher information gain indicates a more informative feature for predicting the target variable. | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)                                                 |
| Chi-square Test | *CHI* | The Chi-square Test evaluates the independence between categorical features and the target variable. Features that show significant association with the target variable are selected based on their Chi-square statistics. | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)                                                 |

| Low Variance Filter | *LVF* | The Low Variance Filter eliminates features with minimal variability across samples, as such features are unlikely to be useful for distinguishing between classes. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master)                                                 |
| Mean Absolute Difference | *MAD* | Mean Absolute Difference evaluates the average difference in feature values between classes. Features with larger differences are prioritized for greater discriminatory power. | [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)                                                       |
| Dispersion Ratio | *DR* | Dispersion Ratio assesses the spread or variability of a feature across samples. Features with distinct dispersion patterns across classes are selected as they are likely to contribute to better classification. | [numpy](https://numpy.org/)                                                        |
| Mutual Information | *MI* | Mutual Information measures the amount of information a feature shares with the target variable. Features with higher mutual information values are more relevant for model inclusion. | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)                                                 |
| ReliefF | *RLF* | ReliefF identifies features that consistently differentiate between instances of different classes by considering the nearest neighbors of each instance. | [scikit-rebate](https://epistasislab.github.io/scikit-rebate/using/)                                                             |
| SURF | *SURF* | The SURF variant extends ReliefF by considering all instances within a predefined distance, enhancing its ability to capture more relevant features. | [scikit-rebate](https://epistasislab.github.io/scikit-rebate/using/)                                                             |
| MultiSURF | *MSURF* | MultiSURF dynamically adjusts the neighborhood size during selection, allowing it to capture complex, multi-feature interactions. | [scikit-rebate](https://epistasislab.github.io/scikit-rebate/using/)                                                             |
| TuRF | *TRF* | TuRF iteratively removes the least informative features, refining the feature set to focus on those with the highest discriminative power. | [scikit-rebate](https://epistasislab.github.io/scikit-rebate/using/)                                                             |
#### 2.2 Embedded methods

Embedded methods incorporate feature selection directly into model training, allowing the learning algorithm to determine the most crucial features. Models such as Random Forest and LASSO regression effectively execute these methods, assigning importance to features throughout the learning phase.

| Methods | Alias | Brief Introduction | Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Lasso | *LASSO* | Lasso performs feature selection by applying L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity in the model by driving the coefficients of less important features to zero. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| Ridge | *RIDGE* | Ridge applies L2 regularization, which penalizes large coefficients, thereby reducing the impact of less important features while retaining all features in the model. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| ElasticNet | *ELASTICNET* | ElasticNet combines the strengths of both Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization), allowing for balanced feature selection with both sparsity and regularization. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| Random Forest Importance | *RF* | Random Forest Importance ranks features based on their contribution to model accuracy. The method leverages the structure of decision trees to identify the most predictive features during the training process. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |

#### 2.3 Wrapper methods

Wrapper methods choose features according to their impact on a selected classifier’s performance, systematically seeking the optimal subset of features. This is done by evaluating various feature combinations and identifying the subset that enhances the model’s performance, typically using techniques such as recursive feature elimination.

| Methods | Alias | Brief Introduction | Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Forward Feature Selection | *FFS* | Forward Feature Selection starts with an empty model, sequentially adding features that improve model performance until no further gain is achieved. This method builds the optimal feature set step by step. | [mlxtend](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) |
| Backward Feature Selection | *BFS* | Backward Feature Selection begins with all features included and iteratively removes the least significant ones. The process continues until the removal of further features results in performance degradation. | [mlxtend](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) |
| Exhaustive Feature Selection | *EFS* | Exhaustive Feature Selection evaluates all possible feature combinations, ensuring the identification of the best subset. Though computationally intensive, it provides the most thorough feature selection. | [mlxtend](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/)  |
| Recursive Feature Selection | *RFS* | Recursive Feature Selection recursively eliminates the least important features, refining the model by retaining only those that contribute the most to prediction accuracy. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| Boruta Algorithm | *BOR* | The Boruta Algorithm iteratively compares the importance of real features with shuffled versions, selecting all features that consistently prove to be more informative than random noise. | [boruta](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v036i11) |

#### 2.4 Hybrid methods

Hybrid approaches combine filter with wrapper or embedded methods to leverage their unique advantages. For instance, features are initially filtered using statistical tests, followed by a wrapper method that enhances the selection by examining interactions with the classifier.

| Methods | Alias | Brief Introduction |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Filter-Wrapper | *FW* | Filter methods are firstly used to reduce the feature set based on relevance, and then wrapper methods refine the selection to identify the optimal features for the model. |
| Filter-Embedded | *FE* | Filter methods are firstly used to reduce the feature set based on relevance, and then embedded methods refine the selection to identify the optimal features for the model. |

### 3. Single modality machine learning model

In this section, we will use supervised machine learning to analyze the **individual feature type** of all samples. The classifiers in the toolkit include **Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting**. The goal of this approach is to assess how effective each classifier is in accurately identifying disease status based on individual feature type. Our methods are applicable to both **binary and multi-class classification** scenarios.

### 4. Multiple modality machine learning model

This section aims to use **multiple feature types** to improve the model performance. Our toolkit include **Concatenation-based, Model-based, and Transformation-based methods** ([Reel *et al, Biotechnol. Adv.*, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975021000458?via%3Dihub/)), applicable to both **binary and multi-class classification** tasks, to maximize model effectiveness across different scenarios. 

#### 4.1 Concatenation-based methods

Concatenation-based methods combine features from different sources by directly appending them into a single feature vector. This straightforward approach allows models to access all available data but relies heavily on the subsequent learning algorithm to handle the potentially high-dimensional space effectively.

#### 4.2 Model-based methods

Model-based integration methods create multiple intermediate models for the different omics data and then build a final model from various intermediate models ([Reel *et al, Biotechnol. Adv.*, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975021000458?via%3Dihub/)). It boosts predictive accuracy by utilizing the strengths of individual models, enabling a deeper understanding of the interactions across different layers.

| Methods |  Alias | Brief Introduction | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Average Voting | *average* | Average Voting combines predictions from multiple models by calculating the mean of their outputs. This method can balance diverse feature impacts, reducing the effect of anomalies in individual features. | 
| Weighted Voting | *weighted* | Weighted Voting assigns weights to individual model predictions based on their performance, using either their proportion of the total AUC or inversely to their error rates. This strategy prioritizes more reliable features when integrating multiple feature sets, enhancing overall prediction accuracy. | 
| Majority Voting | *majority* | Majority Voting selects the most common outcome among various model predictions. It ensures robustness by reducing the influence of sporadically erroneous model outputs. | 
| Stack Ensemble | *stack* | Stack Ensemble uses a meta-model to learn how to best combine the predictions of multiple base models. This method effectively integrates diverse feature-derived predictions to optimize final decision-making processes. | 

#### 4.3 Transformation-based methods

Transformation-based methods transform each of the omics datasets firstly into graphs or kernel matrices and then combine all of them into one before constructing a model ([Reel *et al, Biotechnol. Adv.*, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975021000458?via%3Dihub/)). This approach supports the integration of varied data by standardizing how they are represented.

| Kernel matrix | Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel | *rbf* | The RBF Kernel maps features into a higher-dimensional space using a radial basis function, enabling effective classification of non-linearly separable datasets. This kernel is crucial for multi-feature integration as it can handle complex and non-linear interactions between features. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| Kernel matrix | Sigmoid Kernel | *sigmoid* | The Sigmoid Kernel projects data using a sigmoid function, similar to neural network activation functions. It supports multi-feature integration by transforming features into formats that highlight threshold-based classifications. | [scikit-learn](https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature/tree/master) |
| Network | Similarity network fusion (SNF) | *snf* | SNF integrates multiple types of data by fusing similarity networks, reinforcing common structural features. It excels in multi-feature integration by constructing a holistic network view, revealing deep insights across combined datasets. | [Wang *et al, Nat. Methods*, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2810) |
